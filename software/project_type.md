Project Type
============

There are two primary category types a project may fall into (1) a scientific
project or (2) non-scientific project. Descriptions of each type are included
below. There are different requirements imposed on projects depending on their
project type.


Scientific Project
------------------

Scientific projects are implementations of scientific techniques, methods
and/or algorithms. A best practice is these implementations are documented with
corresponding publications.


Non-Scientific Project
----------------------

Non-scientific projects generally provide a user interface or otherwise render
data. This data may be pre-computed or may be computed on-the-fly using an
external scientific project as a dependency.
