Software Stages
===============

During the development lifecycle, a software project may be in one or more of
the following stages.


Scratch Software
----------------

These exist in folders on local workstations or possibly in the user account
space on GitHub. For example: `https://github.com/{user}/{project}.git`. Where
`{user}` is your user account name and `{project}` is the name of the software
project repository.

These are your own and no restrictions are placed on them.


Preliminary Software
--------------------

These exist in the USGS organization on GitHub. For example:
`https://github.com/usgs/{project}.git`. Where `{project}` is the name of the
project repository.

These may be initiated directly in the USGS organization or may be
migrated from a scratch software project. In the latter case, the scratch
software project must receive a peer [administrative security review][1] prior
to migration.
