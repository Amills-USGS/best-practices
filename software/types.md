Software Types
==============

There are two primary categorizations for software types: (1) scientific
software or (2) non-scientific software. Descriptions of each type are included
below. There are different review requirements imposed on software depending
on their software type categorization.


Scientific Software
-------------------

Scientific software implements scientific techniques, methods and/or
algorithms. Typically (but not always) these techniques, methods and/or
algorithsms are documented in corresponding publications.


Non-Scientific Software
-----------------------

Non-scientific software may perform basic data manipulation (transform data
from one format to another) and/or provide a user interface or otherwise render
data. This data may be pre-computed or may be computed on-the-fly using an
external scientific project as a dependency.
